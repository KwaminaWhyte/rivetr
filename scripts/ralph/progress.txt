## Codebase Patterns
- Team context is managed via React Context in frontend/app/lib/team-context.tsx
- TeamSwitcher component already exists at frontend/app/components/team-switcher.tsx
- API core supports X-Team-Id header via ApiRequestOptions.teamId
- Dashboard layout (_layout.tsx) wraps authenticated routes with TeamProvider
- Container runtime abstraction is in src/runtime/mod.rs (DockerRuntime, PodmanRuntime)
- API routes use Axum in src/api/
- Database uses SQLite with SQLx, migrations in migrations/
- Frontend is React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui in frontend/
- Use anyhow::Result for error handling in Rust code
- State management uses AppState in src/lib.rs with ArcSwap for lock-free updates
- 2 pre-existing test failures in pack_builder and preview modules are unrelated to new work
- Frontend has no "lint" script - use "npm run build" for quality checks
- To auto-open dialogs from URL, use useSearchParams with ?create=true pattern
- System email config is in EmailConfig (src/config/mod.rs), use SystemEmailService (src/notifications/email.rs)
- Email sending is non-blocking: log errors but don't fail requests if email fails
- Use server.external_url from config for building callback URLs (supports ngrok/tunnels)

## 01/10/2026 - US-001
- Created TeamProvider context (frontend/app/lib/team-context.tsx)
  - Stores currentTeamId in React state
  - Persists to localStorage with key 'rivetr_current_team'
  - Loads last active team on mount, or first team if none saved
  - Invalidates relevant queries on team switch (apps, projects, databases, services, stats)
- Updated API core (frontend/app/lib/api/core.ts)
  - Added ApiRequestOptions interface with optional teamId
  - Added X-Team-Id header support for team-scoped requests
- Integrated TeamSwitcher into sidebar (frontend/app/components/app-sidebar.tsx)
  - Connected existing TeamSwitcher component to team context
- Wrapped dashboard layout with TeamProvider
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TeamSwitcher component already existed and was well-designed
  - Pre-existing test failures in pack_builder and preview modules
  - Frontend uses React Query with query invalidation on context changes
---

## 01/10/2026 - US-002
- Enhanced TeamSwitcher component (frontend/app/components/team-switcher.tsx)
  - Added role badges next to team names with variant styling:
    - owner: "default" variant (primary color)
    - admin: "secondary" variant
    - developer/viewer: "outline" variant
  - Added "Create Team" option at bottom of dropdown
  - Uses Badge component from shadcn/ui
- Updated teams settings page (frontend/app/routes/settings/teams.tsx)
  - Added ?create=true query parameter handling
  - Auto-opens create dialog when navigating from team switcher
  - Uses useSearchParams hook from react-router
- Files changed:
  - frontend/app/components/team-switcher.tsx
  - frontend/app/routes/settings/teams.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TeamWithMemberCount type already includes user_role field
  - Frontend has no "lint" script - use "typecheck" or "build" instead
  - Pre-existing TypeScript errors in github-repo-picker.tsx don't break build
  - Badge component supports "default", "secondary", "outline" variants
---

## 01/10/2026 - US-003

  - Added team_id to CreateAppRequest DTO
  - Updated From<App> for AppResponse implementation
- Modified GET /api/apps endpoint (src/api/apps.rs)

  - Filter by team_id when provided
  - Return all apps when no team_id filter (backward compatibility)
  - Support empty string team_id to get legacy/unassigned apps
- Updated app creation INSERT query to include team_id column
- Updated frontend API (frontend/app/lib/api/apps.ts)
  - Modified getApps to accept optional teamId parameter
  - Pass team_id as query parameter
- Updated frontend components to pass team context:
  - nav-apps.tsx - uses currentTeamId from useTeamContext
  - projects/_index.tsx - filters apps by current team
  - projects/$id.tsx - filters allApps by current team
  - settings/notifications.tsx - filters apps for subscription
- Updated frontend types (frontend/app/types/api.ts)
  - Added team_id to App interface
  - Added team_id to CreateAppRequest interface
- Updated server-side API (frontend/app/lib/api.server.ts)

  - frontend/app/routes/projects/_index.tsx
  - frontend/app/routes/projects/$id.tsx

  - frontend/app/types/api.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Apps table already has team_id column from migration 015_teams.sql
  - Query extractor requires explicit serde::Deserialize derive on query structs
  - React Query keys should include team_id to trigger refetch on team switch
  - enabled: currentTeamId !== null prevents queries before team loads

  - Handles multiple states:
    - Loading: Shows spinner while validating
    - Not found: Invalid or removed invitation
    - Expired: Shows "invitation expired" with team name
    - Already accepted: Shows "already accepted" with dashboard link
    - Valid (logged in): Shows accept button that POSTs to /api/invitations/{token}/accept
    - Valid (logged out): Shows login button that stores return URL
  - After accept, redirects to /settings/teams/{team_id}
  - Error handling for: already a member, email mismatch

  - Backend already handles all validation (expired, accepted, email match)
  - Use useMutation for accept action, useEffect for initial validation
  - Card/CardHeader/CardContent/CardFooter provides clean invite UI structure
